# Binary Classification - Machine Learning

The above ipynb has some examples of binary classification using python. The first part compares different the emsemble methods Random Forest, GBDT, and XGBoost.

The second example compares two support vector machines: linear vs non-linear (rbf) to see which better predits the test/holdout data.

Both scenarios are examples of using the out-of-sample mean error rate to decide what model works best for the data

Main Libraries: sklearn, pandas, numpy
